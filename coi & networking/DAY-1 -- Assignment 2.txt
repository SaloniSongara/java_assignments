Accessing the RPS Lab Environment
To access the RPS Lab environment from this home network, the following steps are typically involved:
1.	Secure Remote Access:
*	VPN (Virtual Private Network): Establish a secure connection to the RPS Lab network. This encrypts the data and provides a secure tunnel through the Internet to the lab environment.
*	SSH (Secure Shell): A protocol used to securely log in to remote systems. Often used for accessing command-line interfaces on servers within the lab.

2.	Lab Environment:
*	RPS Lab Network: The network infrastructure within the lab where various servers, workstations, and other resources are located.
*	Accessing Lab Resources: Once connected to the VPN, use SSH or other remote access tools (like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for graphical interfaces) to interact with the lab environment.

Detailed Access Workflow:
1.	Connect to VPN:
*	Use VPN client software on the Desktop Computer or Laptop.
*	Enter VPN credentials to establish a secure connection to the RPS Lab network.

2.	Use SSH:
*	Open a terminal on the Desktop Computer or Laptop.
*	Use the ssh command to connect to a specific server or workstation within the RPS Lab.
*	Example command: ssh username@lab-server-ip-address

3.	Perform Tasks in RPS Lab:
*	Once logged in via SSH, execute commands, run programs, or manage resources within the lab environment as needed.

By following these steps, a user can securely access and interact with the RPS Lab environment from their home network.
