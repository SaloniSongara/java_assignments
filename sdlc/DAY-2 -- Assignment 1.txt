1). Planning : 
•	Gathering client’s requirements
•	Defining project scope
•	Set objectives & goals
•	Resource planning

2). Requirement analysis :

•	Actual developments starts here
•	Coding is done by developers
•	Review the code developed as per requirement

5). Testing : 
•	Tests whether the developed product meets the client requirement or not
•	Improves the overall quality of the software
•	System testing, manual testing and automated testing happens here

6). Deployment : 
•	Code is released in real world environment
•	End user do the testing in real world environment

7). Maintenance : 
•	After services provided to the customer after deployment as per service 	agreement
•	Patch update, log file capture, version updates are done in maintenance 	phase
•	Makes software more reliable, stable and up to date as per user 	feedback
